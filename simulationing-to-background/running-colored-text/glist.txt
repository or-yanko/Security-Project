‚ÄúMy very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of memory, over which, if you can still stand my style (I am writing under observation), the sun of my infancy had set: surely, you all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusk; a furry warmth, golden midges.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe French are certainly misunderstood: ‚Äî but whether the fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves, or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such importance, and which, moreover, is so likely to be contested by us ‚Äî or whether the fault may not be altogether on our side, in not understanding their language always so critically as to know ‚Äúwhat they would be at‚Äù ‚Äî I shall not decide; but ‚Äòtis evident to me, when they affirm, ‚ÄúThat they who have seen Paris, have seen every thing,‚Äù they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by day-light.‚Äù

For example, in Java and C#, you have two distinct functions, while other languages require you to explicitly append \n at the end of a string literal.|
Note: You may be wondering why the end parameter has a fixed default value rather than whatever makes sense on your operating system.|
